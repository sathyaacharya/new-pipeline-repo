Slave ==> someone who works on instructions provided by master
master ==> owner who instructs 

Master & slave in jenkins
------------------------------------
master ==> server where we have installed jenkins 
slave/worker ==>  which will be connected to jenkins master, which follow instructions given by jenkins master & executes jobs.


Why do we need to use master/slave setup ?
----------------------------------------------------------------
-  To reduce workloads on master server & distribute it to different servers.
-   if we want to run specific job on specific server


Important  NOTE:
---------------------------
Dual meanings:
    nodes == agent == slaves == workers ==> all are same terminolgies



==============Jenkins-Slave- Setup Practicals====================

Step1): Launch Slave ec2-server and install java
           
		   yum install java-1.8* -y


Step2) : Create a Jenkins user, set password, create jenkins path and enable the password authentication to yes

        useradd jenkins
        
        passwd jenkins
        
        mkdir /var/lib/jenkins
        
        chown  -R jenkins:jenkins   /var/lib/jenkins
        
        vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        
        PasswordAuthentication no to yes
        
        service  sshd restart


#### Configurations needs to be done in JENKINS UI #### 

Step3):  Add the jenkins user name and password in jenkins Credentials section

how to add credentials in jenkins?
   Manage Jenkins==> Credentials ==> Add credentials
   It will open credentials configuration page:
         Kind==>username with password
         Scope==>Global Username==> jenkins user name (created in slave server in step2)
         Password==> password of Jenkins user (created in slave server in step2)


Step4):   Add Node/Slave server in Jenkins Master  
 
***********important_interview_question************
How do you add slave in jenkins / steps involved in adding slave to jenkins ?

Manage Jenkins==> Manage Nodes and Clouds==>New Node ==> provide Node name and select Permanent Agent and then click on create

It will  open node configuration page

             Name ==>Slave server name (can be any)
             
             Number of executors ==>The number of parallel jobs, which we can runs at a time
             
             Remote root directory ==>  directory path on slave server, where job gets executed
             
             Labels ==>give any name, ## labels will be used to control where we can run job  (it can be on master/slave) 
             
             Launch method ==> Launch agents via SSH Method
             
             Host ==> Slave server IP
             
             Credentials==> select the Jenkins credentials  created to access slave server
             
             Host Key Verification Strategy ==> Manually trusted key verification  startegy

click on Save.



How to Run job in slave?
---------------------------------
in configuration page of any jenkins job & under description section
   select ==> Restrict where this project can be run  ==> labelname  ( give labelname of slave added)

How to add user in jenkins?
JenkinsDashBoard ==> ManageJenkins==> Security section ==>manageUser==> create user 



***********important_interview_question************

How do you secure jenkins / what kind of security mechanism you have implemented in jenkins?
==> we have implemented Matrix-based security, it will allow us to control users permissions, we can select checkboxes to give permissions.
       for developers we have only provdided permissions to create, configure & run job. 
	   
	  Steps to implement  Matrix-based security
	  JenkinsDashBoard ==> ManageJenkins==> Security section ==> Configure global security ==> Authorization ==> Matrix-based security ==> adduser
	  select user ==> give permission which are applicable ==> save
